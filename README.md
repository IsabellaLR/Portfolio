### 👋 Hello! I am an iOS engineer with experience building applications that utilize modern AI technology and have been installed by thousands of users. I also have Android experience and am an ML enthusiast. I majored in both Biology + Computer Science at UC Berkeley, and minored in Chinese Language. ###

I started making apps during my Freshman year of college after participating in the Make School Summer Academy, where I launched and demoed my first app. Since then, I've created and released many apps for fun. My recent app, HaiBella, uses newer Swift technologies and is powered by AI to provide a unique language learning experience to build vocabulary more effectively. I use it myself daily to improve my Mandarin! Here are some past projects I created!

Ever wondered how fast you could learn vocabulary while chatting if you could just say words you don't know in your native language, and automatically save those words for review? HaiBella does that for you. As you chat in mixed language in chats tailored to your skill level, get instant corrections with new vocabulary automatically saved from your messages or manually saved from your tutor's messages for Spaced Repetition Review! Reviews show the exact sentence the word came from in your chats, helping you utilize the power of the [Generation Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_effect) to learn vocabulary effectively!

Main Features: 
- Chat with an AI tutor about a topic or scenario in mixed language with difficulty specific to selected language level. Get automatic corrections for chats, and translated vocabulary automatically saved for review.
- Tap individual words in chat messsages to see their translations and manually save them for review if desired. View translations for all words in DictionaryMode UI.
- Review words saved via Spaced Repetition System in flashcards, with their translations, pronunciations if applicable, and original sentences, marking them as known or unknown until mastered.
- Set goals to master a certain number of words by a selected date, with daily instructions to stay on track, and automatic analysis of key metrics for accurate estimation of goal achievability and time commitment.
- Customization of chat settings such as formality/style (e.g. casual, formal, Gen Z, flirty), audio speed, difficulty, etc.

## Circal
Often, college students miss out on making connections with people outside of their class schedule and routine. Circal is an iOS app that gives university students the ability to explore and connect with students both at their school & colleges across the country.

Main Features: 
- Discover peers with similar interests and hobbies, or in the same classes, major, dorm, etc. through a discovery page with a search bar; it can be used to query for student profiles that include the searched keyword such as "Immunology".
- Match with students based on fun questions such as "Favorite Star Wars Character?". Students have the option to match within their year, for friends or dating, with students from other schools, and add up to 5 pictures, among other things.
- Create and join group chats with messenger-like functionality categorized by hobbies, academic interests, sports, and miscellaneous. Easy to find, create, and join chats. Chats are recommended to students based on their interests.
- Video chat through a "live match" feature with a random student. Each time a student presses next, they'll be paired with a new student currently using the feature.

## Water We Doin
Latest estimates reveal that 3 in 10 people worldwide could not wash their hands with soap and water at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to WHO and UNICEF, billions of people will lack access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in 2030 unless progress quadruples.

Water We Doin is an Android app that lets scientists track global water accessibility, and users record their amount of daily water consumption. This app serves as a tool for both data collection and visualization. We hope organizations can utilize this data in a meaningful way and, in the future, provide better analysis and water services, especially for areas facing water scarcity.

Main Features - for data collection: 
- Select from different custom-animated and volume-calculated water containers (e.g., jugs, cans, plastic bottles)
- Hold finger to fill a container with the amount of water consumed (in Litres), with the amount filled also displayed
- Update the total water consumed throughout the day by adding the amount filled for a specific container via the plus button
- View recent water intake as a bar or line graph, with the weekly and monthly averages shown

Main Features - for data visualization: 
- View an interactive heatmap of places with the lowest daily average water consumption from real-time data (light green to dark red) with dark red signifying the lowest levels
- Touch a country to view related stats such as average water consumption levels, the number of cities with data, and a list of the ten cities with the lowest water consumption levels, and a button to view more cities
- Swipe the displayed stats to see a graph form of the data

##### 🔨Technologies: Java, Firestore, animations, Graph API, Google Places API, heatmap
##### 👾Role & Timeframe: All Firestore functionality, backend, heatmap, map UI and interactivity, handling data/numbers for screens, dates for recent intake graphs. Made app with 2 interns at Facebook University in 4 weeks
##### 🚀Platform: 📱Android

## BlossomVR Companion App
BlossomVR is a VR game set in a world in which through biofeedback, players perform meditative activites ranging from tai chi to progressive muscle relaxation. Players restore various life forms that respond to their heart rate, breathing patterns, and more. The startup is part of Oculus Launchpad, FreenVentures, and XR @ Berkeley. 

The mobile companion app is an iOS & Apple Watch app that syncs biofeedback data (e.g., heart rate from the apple watch) of players during their interaction with the game. This data is sent to Firebase and recieved on the Unity end to adjust the dynamic visuals and life forms the players are interacting with in the VR game.

##### 🔨Technologies: Swift, watchOS, HealthKit
##### 👾Role & Timeframe: Sole Developer. Spring 2021.
##### 🚀Platform: 📱iOS, ⌚️watchOS
